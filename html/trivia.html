            <li>Murlocs first appeared in Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (July 2002). A Murky pet was added to World of Warcraft in 2005, and Murky appears in World of Warcraft: Legion (August 2016).</li>
            <li>Murky is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.</li>
            <li>Murky was one of the four heroes revealed at PAX East 2014.</li>
            <li>Murky originally lived in the coast of Feralas in Traveler (October 2016).
                However, he was kidnapped by a band of thugs and held captive, but was later rescued by a pair of children and a wyvern the size of a giraffe.</li>
            <li>Many of the opening lines involving Murky are expressions of confusion at the murloc language. Even Malfurion mentions he has to brush up on it. Certain heroes, notably the telepathic protoss and the supernatural angels and demons, are able to understand what Murky is saying. The more noble of these (Tassadar, Zeratul, Fenix, Tyrael, and Auriel) react as either offended or scared of the little Murloc's bloodthirsty demeanor and desire for vengeance. Even Diablo is a little scared of him. On the other hand, Alarak actually likes the "little fish creature", and Malthael is flat out impressed to find someone who understands his "great work".</li>
